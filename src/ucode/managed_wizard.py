"""Interactive `ucode setup`: author the workspace's managed coding-agent config.

Workspace admins run this to build the ``CodingAgentConfig`` their developers will pull, then publish
it with ``ucode publish`` (a separate command, so the manifest can be reviewed first). The config lives
at ``~/.ucode/managed-state.json`` (the one local managed-config file, owned by
:mod:`ucode.managed_config`).

Authoring is split across commands so an admin can change one part without walking the whole flow:
``ucode setup`` picks the agents and models, and ``ucode setup mcps`` / ``skills`` / ``spend-tiers``
each edit their own section of the same manifest. ``ucode setup`` carries the other sections forward
untouched (:func:`_carry_forward_sections`), and ``ucode setup help`` prints the whole sequence.

Serialization, validation, and the per-agent model catalogs live in :mod:`ucode.managed_setup`; this
module is the interaction layer on top of them. Sub-flows an admin already knows — MCP, skills — are
delegated to the existing ``ucode configure <thing>`` commands and their results read back out of
``state.json``, so there is exactly one picker per concern in the codebase.

    ``default_opus_model`` to a known-good ``claude-opus-4-8`` is a normal thing for an admin to

    had just offered:

        claude: model 'system.ai.claude-opus-4-8' is not available on this workspace.

    The wizard stashes the full listing on ``state["all_claude_models"]`` mid-run, but that is never
    persisted — `setup` saves the manifest, not the state — so a separate `ucode publish` process
    starts from a fresh ``load_state()`` without it. Re-fetching here makes the check independent of
    what the wizard happened to leave behind, which also covers a hand-edited or ``--from-file``
    manifest authored on another machine.
