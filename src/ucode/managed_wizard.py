"""Interactive `ucode setup`: author the workspace's managed coding-agent config.

Workspace admins run this to build the ``CodingAgentConfig`` their developers will pull. It walks
the admin through agents, per-agent models, tracing, MCP servers, skills, and a spend-routing budget
policy, then writes the manifest to ``~/.ucode/managed-settings.json``. Publishing it to the
workspace is ``ucode apply`` (a separate command, so an admin can review the file first).

Serialization, validation, and the per-agent model catalogs live in :mod:`ucode.managed_setup`; this
module is the interaction layer on top of them. Sub-flows an admin already knows — tracing, MCP,
skills — are delegated to the existing ``ucode configure <thing>`` commands and their results read
back out of ``state.json``, so there is exactly one picker per concern in the codebase.

    """``state`` plus the full Claude listing, for validating a manifest against the workspace.

    ``state["claude_models"]`` holds only the newest id per family (the launch path pins one model
    per family alias), but `ucode setup` deliberately offers the older versions too — pinning
    ``default_opus_model`` to a known-good ``claude-opus-4-8`` is a normal thing for an admin to
    want. Validating against ``claude_models`` alone therefore rejected a model the wizard itself
    had just offered:

        claude: model 'system.ai.claude-opus-4-8' is not available on this workspace.

    The wizard stashes the full listing on ``state["all_claude_models"]`` mid-run, but that is never
    persisted — `setup` saves the manifest, not the state — so a separate `ucode apply` process
    starts from a fresh ``load_state()`` without it. Re-fetching here makes the check independent of
    what the wizard happened to leave behind, which also covers a hand-edited or ``--from-file``
    manifest authored on another machine.

    Best-effort: a failed listing returns ``state`` untouched, leaving validation on the narrower
