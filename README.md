# Unity AI Gateway Coding CLI (ucode)

`ucode` is a lightweight launcher for running Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Pi through Databricks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ — install with `uv` ([uv.astral.sh](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- `npm` if tool CLIs need to be installed automatically

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/databricks/ucode
```

Check your version with `ucode --version`. Between releases this looks like
`0.1.0+14.g93986a8` — the trailing `g<hash>` is the exact commit the build came
from, so include it when reporting a bug.

---

## Usage

Just run the tool you want:

```bash
ucode codex      # OpenAI Codex
ucode claude     # Claude Code
ucode gemini     # Gemini CLI
ucode opencode   # OpenCode
ucode copilot    # GitHub Copilot CLI
ucode pi         # Pi
ucode cursor     # Cursor Agent (MCP only — see below)
```

On first launch, `ucode` will prompt for your Databricks workspace URL, authenticate, and configure that tool automatically. Subsequent launches go straight to the agent.

Pass flags directly to the underlying tool:

```bash
ucode claude -r          # resume last session
ucode codex --full-auto
```

All agents route through Databricks AI Gateway using your workspace credentials — no API keys required.

Smart routing is opt-in for Codex and Claude Code. Enabling it asks the AI Gateway router
to select the root-session model before launch and installs profile-scoped hooks that route
future subagent calls. Codex may require one-time review of the installed hooks through `/hooks`.

```bash
ucode codex --enable-smart-routing
ucode claude --enable-smart-routing
```

The setting persists per workspace for each agent. Disable and remove only ucode's routing
hooks with:

```bash
ucode codex --disable-smart-routing
ucode claude --disable-smart-routing
```

To configure all tools at once:

```bash
ucode configure
```

To configure specific tools without the picker, pass a comma-separated list:

```bash
ucode configure --agents claude,codex
```

Available agent names are `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `copilot`, and `pi`. `cursor` is also accepted (MCP-only — it registers Databricks MCP servers but configures no models).

To configure without the workspace picker, pass a comma-separated list of workspaces:

```bash
ucode configure --workspaces https://first.databricks.com,https://second.databricks.com
```

When multiple workspaces are provided, `ucode` logs into and saves state for each workspace. Launch commands such as `ucode codex` use the first workspace in the list.

Alternatively, pass existing Databricks CLI profiles (from `~/.databrickscfg`) instead of workspace URLs — each profile's host supplies the workspace URL:

```bash
ucode configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex
```

Auth behaves the same as `--workspaces`: an OAuth `databricks auth login` is forced by default.

For CI or headless environments where the profile holds a personal access token (`auth_type = pat` in `~/.databrickscfg`), add `--use-pat`. It must be combined with `--profiles` — ucode never picks up a PAT implicitly — and runs no interactive login: the profile's token is used for the whole setup (and by launched agents afterwards), with workspace access verified against the AI Gateway. `--skip-validate` additionally skips the post-configure test message sent through each agent, so configure only writes config files with the freshly discovered models. Together these make setup fully non-interactive:

```bash
ucode configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex --use-pat --skip-validate --skip-upgrade
```

### MCP servers (optional)

```bash
ucode configure mcp
```

Add Databricks MCP servers to installed MCP-capable tools: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Cursor Agent.
Options are shown in this order:

- Discovered external MCP connections
- Databricks SQL
- Managed Databricks MCPs (Vector Search, UC Functions, etc.)
- Custom MCP server URL

Discovered external MCP connections are listed directly.

Every Databricks MCP server is registered as a local **stdio** server that runs `ucode mcp-proxy`
— a small bridge (shipped with `ucode`) between the coding tool and the Databricks
streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint. The proxy mints a fresh OAuth token from your Databricks CLI profile
on every request, so MCP auth is handled uniformly for every client and never expires mid-session.
The coding tool starts and stops the proxy as a child process; there's nothing extra to run.

**Cursor** is MCP-only: `cursor-agent` runs models on your own Cursor account, so `ucode`
configures no models for it — it only registers Databricks MCP servers in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
(via the same proxy). Include it with `ucode configure --agents cursor` or pick it in
`ucode configure mcp`, then launch with `ucode cursor`.

To set up an agent and its MCP server(s) in one command, pass `--mcp` with fully-qualified
service name(s) to `ucode configure`:

```bash
ucode configure --agents claude --mcp system.ai.slack
```

`--mcp` also works without `--agents` for MCP-only clients (it configures just the workspace,
then registers the servers); pass a comma-separated list to register several at once.

### Skills (optional)

Configure Unity Catalog Skills for your coding tools with `ucode configure skills`:

```bash
# Utility tools only: register the schema-less skills MCP connection, no download.
ucode configure skills

# Download mode: fetch every skill in the schema to disk (and register the connection).
ucode configure skills --location main.default --path /abs/project/dir

# Download a named subset of the schema's skills instead of all of them.
ucode configure skills --location main.default --skill my-skill

# MCP mode: expose the schema's skills as MCP tools instead of downloading.
ucode configure skills --location main.default,ml.prod --mcp
```

- **Bare command** (no `--location`) registers the schema-less skills MCP connection — the
  cross-schema utility tools only — and downloads nothing. `--mcp` with no `--location` does the
  same.
- **Download mode** (with `--location`, no `--mcp`) writes each skill flat as `<leaf>/SKILL.md`
  (plus its bundled files) into both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. `--path` (an existing
  absolute directory) is optional; when omitted, skills are written under your home directory. Any
  pre-existing skill dir prompts before it's overwritten. It then registers a schema-less skills
  MCP connection, leaving any prior `--mcp` scope untouched. `--skill <name>[,<name>…]` narrows the
  download to the named skills (by leaf name) from the schema instead of all of them; requested
  names not found in the schema warn and are skipped. `--skill` requires a single `--location`, is
  download-only, and is rejected with `--mcp`.
- **MCP mode** (`--location … --mcp`) sets the connection's location set to exactly `<list>`
  (override-only) and rebuilds its `?schema=` URL; no files are downloaded and `--path` is rejected.

Each run prints the registered server, its URL, the configured agents, and its tools, and reminds
you to run `ucode <agent>` (existing agent sessions need a restart before the MCP tools load).

### Managed config for a workspace (admins)

```bash
ucode setup
```

Author the coding config your developers pick up automatically, instead of asking each of them to
run `ucode configure` by hand. Restricted to workspace admins.

The flow walks through the agents to enable and which one bare `ucode` launches, then per agent:
Databricks-hosted models or an external Model Provider Service, the models to expose, and whether
the config applies machine-wide or per user. Claude Code is asked one model per family
(opus/sonnet/haiku/fable), since Claude Code selects models by family alias; any family can be
skipped. It then offers tracing, managed MCP servers, skills, and a spend-based budget policy that
switches the default agent and model as the workspace burns through a budget.

The result is written to `~/.ucode/managed-settings.json`, which `ucode apply` publishes to the
workspace. Your own agent configs are left alone, with one exception: answering yes to tracing, MCP
servers, or skills runs the matching `ucode configure` step, which does configure this machine.

```bash
# Review the manifest and the exact payload `ucode apply` would publish.
ucode setup show

# Walk the flow without writing anything.
ucode setup --dry-run

# Skip the prompts and load a hand-written config instead (validated before saving).
ucode setup --from-file ./managed-settings.json
```

Once the manifest looks right, publish it:

```bash
# Validate, show what would change, and ask before publishing.
ucode apply

# Publish without the confirmation prompt (for CI).
ucode apply --yes
```

`apply` updates the workspace's existing config in place rather than replacing it, so a failed
publish leaves the current config intact. It is still a whole-manifest write: every field ucode
authors is sent, so anything skipped in a re-run is cleared rather than carried over. Developers
pick the new config up on their next ucode run.
